# README

## Overview
This project was created to streamline the management of multiple websites and projects at a company that was resistant to adopting newer technologies. The company hosted and managed hundreds of static HTML websites, and modernizing them with more advanced frameworks or CMS platforms was not an option.

## Purpose
To ensure minimal upkeep while still introducing a level of reusability and efficiency, this project leverages PHPâ€”a simple yet effective older technology that allows for easy maintenance without requiring major infrastructural changes. By implementing PHP in a lightweight manner, I was able to dynamically update key website details (such as company name, phone number, and email) across multiple sites without modifying each individual static HTML file.

## Features
- Uses PHP to replace hardcoded details with dynamic variables.
- Minimal setup required, making it easy to deploy across legacy websites.
- Maintains the simplicity of static HTML while allowing for centralized updates.
- Reduces maintenance overhead for hundreds of managed websites.

## Why PHP?
- It is widely supported and requires no additional dependencies beyond a basic web server.
- Allows for minimal, structured updates without disrupting existing website functionality.
- Works seamlessly with existing HTML files without forcing a full site rebuild.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how even older technologies like PHP can be used strategically to improve efficiency without forcing a company-wide transition to newer frameworks. It serves as a practical solution for businesses that need lightweight, scalable updates without the complexities of modern web stacks.
